## About FOSSology

FOSSology is an open source license compliance software system and toolkit. As a toolkit, you can run license, copyright and export control scans from the command line. As a system, a database and web UI are provided to give you a compliance workflow. In one click you can generate an SPDX file or a ReadMe with all the copyrights notices from your software. FOSSology deduplication means that you can scan an entire distro, rescan a new version, and only the changed files will get rescanned. This is a big time saver for large projects.

## Overview

The UI Migration project is an effort focused on generating the new component-based architecture with the integration of the APIs. To make the project more **efficient** and **easily accessible**, an entire code base shift from Symfony-Twig to React.js is proposed. React.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. React.js component system will enable us to organize the current working APIs appropriately.

## Objectives

- Working on good interactive design, with a modern look.
- Integrating the APIs to the new component-based UI structure.
- Seamless routing and page transitions.
- Giving the power of the node engine to our UI. Making all NPM accessible.
- Writing detailed â€‹ documentation of the project, to make the
  codebase simpler for other contributors.

## Installation

### Docker

FOSSology comes with a Dockerfile allowing the containerized execution.

Run the following commands inside the project directory.

```sh
docker build \
-t fossologyui:react1.0 \
--build-arg REACT_APP_SERVER_URL="localhost/repo/api/v2" \
--build-arg REACT_APP_HTTPS="false" .
```

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 fossologyui:react1.0
```

The docker image can then be used using http://IP_OF_DOCKER_HOST:3000/ user fossy password fossy.

In the project directory, you can run:

create a `.env` in root directory of project and copy the contents from `.env.sample`

#### `yarn`

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`
