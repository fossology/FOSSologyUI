If the software is modified by someone else\n              and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have\n              is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others\n              will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n              patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n              program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making\n              the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\n              that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\n              licensed at all.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and\n              modification follow.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"terms-conditions\">\n          <div className=\"primary-color-wrapper text-center font-bold my-4\">\n            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <ol className=\"font-regular\" start=\"0\">\n              <li className=\"mt-4\">\n                This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n                a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\n                distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

By contrast, the GNU General\n              Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share\n              and change free software--to make sure the software is free for\n              all its users.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n              specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of\n              the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use\n              it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully\n              about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License\n              is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the\n              explanations below.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of\n              use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make\n              sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free\n              software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you\n              receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can\n              change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and\n              that you are informed that you can do these things.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n              distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\n              these rights. These restrictions translate to certain\n              responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library\n              or if you modify it.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether\n              gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\n              that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\n              can get the source code. If you link other code with the library,\n              you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that\n              they can relink them with the library after making changes to the\n              library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so\n              they know their rights.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright\n              the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you\n              legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n              there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is\n              modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n              that what they have is not the original version, so that the\n              original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that\n              might be introduced by others.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence\n              of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n              effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n              restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist\n              that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must\n              be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this\n              license.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n              ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser\n              General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,\n              and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\n              We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit\n              linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or\n              using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally\n              speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.\n              The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking\n              only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The\n              Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for\n              linking other code with the library.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because\n              it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary\n              General Public License. It also provides other free software\n              developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\n              These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\n              Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license\n              provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n              encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\n              becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs\n              must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a\n              free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\n              In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library\n              to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public\n              License.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n              programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n              free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n              non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n              operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\n              system.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of\n              the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that\n              is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to\n              run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n              modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between\n              a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".\n              The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the\n              latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"terms-conditions-copy\">\n          <div className=\"primary-color-wrapper text-center font-bold my-4\">\n            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <ol className=\"font-regular\" start=\"0\">\n              <li className=\"mt-4\">\n                This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n                a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\n                distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

For a library, complete source\n                code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus\n                any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used\n                to control compilation and installation of the library.\n                <br />\n                Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\n                not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.

Whether that is true\n                depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses\n                the Library does.\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"mt-4\">\n                You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n                complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided\n                that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n                appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep\n                intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\n                absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License\n                along with the Library.\n                <br />\n                You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n                copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n                exchange for a fee.\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"mt-4\">\n                You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n                of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n                distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n                1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n                <ol type=\"a\" className=\"mt-2\">\n                  <li>The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>\n                  <li>\n                    You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any\n                    change.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n                    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function\n                    or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\n                    that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed\n                    when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good\n                    faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application\n                    does not supply such function or table, the facility still\n                    operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains\n                    meaningful.\n                  </li>\n                </ol>\n                (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots\n                has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n                application.
