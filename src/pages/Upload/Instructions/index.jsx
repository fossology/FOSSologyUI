        Select optional analysis FOSSology has many options for importing and
        uploading files for analysis. The options vary based on <i>where</i> the
        data to upload is located. The data may be located:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>On your browser system</b>. Use the{" "}
            <Link to={routes.upload.file}> Upload File </Link>
            option to select and upload the file.
            <ul>
              <li>
                While this can be very convenient (particularly if the file is
                not readily accessible online), uploading via your web browser
                can be slow for large files, and files larger than 650 Megabytes
                may not be uploadable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>On a remote server</b>. Use the{" "}
            <Link to={routes.upload.url}> Upload from URL </Link>
            option to specify a remote server.
            <ul>
              <li>
                This is the most flexible option, but the URL must denote a
                publicly accessible HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP location.
              </li>
              <li>
                URLs that require authentication or human interactions cannot be
                downloaded through this automated system.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>On the FOSSology web server</b>. Use the{" "}
            <Link to={routes.upload.server}> Upload from Server </Link>
            option to specify a file or path on the server.
            <ul>
              <li>
                This option is intended for developers who have mounted
                directories containing source trees.
              </li>
              <li>
                The directory must be accessible via the web server's user.
              </li>
              {/* <li>
              The list of allowed folders can be modified in
              <a href="/repo/?mod=foconfig"> Configuration Variables </a>.
            </li> */}
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>On the version control system</b>. Use the{" "}

              {" "}
              Upload from Version Control System{" "}

        If your system is configured to use multiple agent servers, the data
        area must be mounted and accessible to the FOSSology user (fossy) on
